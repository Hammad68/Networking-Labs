# Networks & Systems Security – Portfolio
This final submission contains all security labs in fully formatted Jupyter Notebooks. The work spans system hardening, network analysis, secure communication, vulnerability assessment, malware behaviour, and GenAI attack surfaces.

## Core Work:

- **CIA Triad**: conceptual basis.

- **Auth & Crypto**: bcrypt, MFA, lockouts, hybrid RSA–AES.

- **Recon & Scanning**: passive recon, TCP scanner, Nmap.

- **Vulnerability Analysis**: CSP/HSTS, cookies, clickjacking, MIME issues.

- **Pen-Testing Workflow**: recon → scan → enumerate → assess.

- **Malicious Software**: signatures, heuristics, sandboxing, evasion.

- **GenAI Security**: prompt injection, model manipulation.

### Submission Summary: 
- Scripts moved to notebooks and the written report reformatted per **Week 8** feedback.
- This is the completed **Week 10** final submission.
